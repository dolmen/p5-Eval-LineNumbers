NAME
    Eval::LineNumbers - Add line numbers to heredoc blocks that contain perl
    source code

SYNOPSIS
     use Eval::LineNumbers qw(eval_line_numbes);

     eval eval_line_numbers(<<END_HEREIS);
       code
     END_HEREIS

DESCRIPTION
    Add a "#line "this-file" 392" comment to heredoc/hereis text that is
    going to be eval'ed so that error messages will point back to the right
    place.

    Please note: when you embed "\n" in your code, it gets expanded in
    double-quote hereis documents so it will mess up your line numbering.
    Use "\\n" instead when you can.
